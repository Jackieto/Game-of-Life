## Introduction
Jackieto's Game of Life is my own version of the classical [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
written in C++. In this version I tried to challenge my data structures and algorithms skills, and also taking a first look at graphics using
SDL2.

## Future
While the Game of Life itself its already done, I'm planning to play with the algorithm and even trying to implement new features, stay tuned!
